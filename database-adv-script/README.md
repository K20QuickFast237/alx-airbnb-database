## Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins

**Instructions:**

- Write a query using an _INNER JOIN_ to retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

- Write a query using a _LEFT JOIN_ to retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

- Write a query using a _FULL OUTER JOIN_ to retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

## Write both correlated and non-correlated subqueries.

**Instructions:**

- Write a query to find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0 using a subquery.
- Write a correlated subquery to find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

## Use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze data.

**Instructions:**

- Write a query to find the total number of bookings made by each user, using the COUNT function and GROUP BY clause.
- Use a window function (*ROW_NUMBER*, *RANK*) to rank properties based on the total number of bookings they have received.
